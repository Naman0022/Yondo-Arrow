An yondo arrow marvel prototype. The Yondu Arrow is a whistle-controlled arrow made from Yaka that uses technology native to the Centaurian people. The Yaka Arrow was Yondu Udonta's favored weapon.  
  
With self-propelling and extremely modulated anti-gravitational technology, the arrows themselves are able to defy gravity and move freely through the air at great speeds as well as being highly durable and sharp.  
till no the arrow is controllable via WASD keys and **still working on more realistic wind particle system.**
